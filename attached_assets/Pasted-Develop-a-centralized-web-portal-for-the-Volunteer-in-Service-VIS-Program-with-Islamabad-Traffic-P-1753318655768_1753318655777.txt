Develop a centralized web portal for the Volunteer in Service (VIS) Program with Islamabad Traffic Police, focusing on attendance, scheduling, and highlights management for efficient communication and record-keeping. 

🎯 **Objective**: Eliminate manual paperwork and WhatsApp/text-based communication by digitizing attendance and planning processes, providing a professional and exportable platform. 

💻 **Target Users**: 
1. **Primary Admin**: CR (Class Representative) responsible for managing the system.
2. **Secondary (Optional)**: Fellow students, for viewing schedules and attendance summaries. 

🔨 **Core Features**:
1. **Attendance Management System**:
   - **Student Registry**: Add, update, and delete student information (Name, Reg No, Batch).
   - **Mark Attendance**: Display all registered students for a selected date, with options to mark 'Present' or default 'Absent'.
   - **View Past Attendance**: Filter by student name, reg no, or batch and export data to Excel.
   - **Bonus**: Bulk attendance import and monthly attendance report generation.

2. **Daily Highlights / Visit Points**:
   - **Add New Entry**: Include date, title, and description with rich text support.
   - **View Archive**: Display entries in reverse-chronological order.
   - **Bonus**: Image uploads and shareable links.

3. **Schedule Manager**:
   - **Add New Schedule**: Record date, time, title, description, and optional location.
   - **Display Schedule**: Show today's and tomorrow's schedule on the dashboard.
   - **Bonus**: Google Calendar sync and email notifications.

🎨 **UI/UX Design Requirements**:
- **Dashboard**: Quick access to today's schedule, attendance marking, and daily highlights posting.
- **Navigation Bar**: Includes links to Dashboard, Attendance, Highlights, and Schedule.
- **Mobile-Responsive**: Ensure seamless operation on mobile devices.
- **Dark Mode**: Provide an optional dark mode for user comfort.

📊 **Database Schema**:
1. **Students**: id (PK), name, reg_no, batch
2. **Attendance**: id (PK), student_id (FK → students.id), date, status
3. **Highlights**: id (PK), date, title, description
4. **Schedule**: id (PK), date, title, description, location

🔐 **Authentication**:
- Implement a login system with admin privileges.
- Admins can create student and admin accounts, with students requiring admin approval post-signup.
- Students must provide full name, email, password, and registration number for account creation.

💻 **Technical Considerations**:
- The portal should be developed as a responsive web app with a modern UI/UX style, using frameworks like React or Vue.js. 
- Utilize a color palette that is professional yet engaging, such as navy blue, white, and light grey, drawing inspiration from platforms like Notion for a minimalistic approach.
